# About
* This is the web implementation of my beat detection algorithm hosted using netlify. Unfortunately it does not perform as well as the Python and C++ implementations as Web Audio Api limits the number of samples taken at a time (128) and Chrome limits its sample rate to 48000Hz ONLY. This results in atrocious frequency precision (375 Hz increments).
